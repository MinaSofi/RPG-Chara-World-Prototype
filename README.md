# RPG-Chara-World-Prototype

This is only a prototype for the actual RPG Chara World website. Hence it is hard-coded to gather all the info about my characters at this point. Later this website will have the option to:

- make users -> register/login
- add characters through the website
- edit character pages' through the website
- have more media options
- run with react

The outlook of the website is old-schoolish and I intend to keep it that way since there was a magic of its own back in the day <3
